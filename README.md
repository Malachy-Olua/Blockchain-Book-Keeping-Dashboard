## Project Description
Blockchain-Book-Keeping-Dashboard is a blockchain web application that helps an organisation(small and medium scale) to keep track of their spendings either paying of salary to employees or any other expenses.

It promotes paying of salary in cryptocurrency as oppossed the normal fiat currency salary payments.

Each salary payment is mapped to the employee with the date and time the payment was made.

The app is customised for the company or organisation alone. It is made in such a way that its only the company or organisation's manager or whoever is responsible for making payments and keeping the records will have access to the web app.
